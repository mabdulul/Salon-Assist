This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Salon-Assist 

The goal of this project was to create an application that would allow customers of a salon to complete a questionnaire. Once they complete it, Stylist would have information about their clients. This application allows customers to create a login, complete a questionnaire, make appointments, and add comments to future appointments. The customers would also be able to edit the questionnaire and view future and past appointments.

## Technologies Used
React, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, Node, Express, Context API, Momentjs.

## Design 
I design everything to expected the homepage. The design of Salon-Assist was inspired by different salon website and the questionnaire was inspired by quizzes I found online. 

## Challenges
Creating the login for users

## Stretch Goals
I would like to add a login for Stylist. The stylist would be able to view all upcoming appointments and add comments to their appointments.
